# Molecular-Modeling-in-Drug-Discovery

## Project overview
The objective of this project is to identify a potent ligand inhibitor for the 5CNO protein (EGFR kinase), which is implicated in various types of cancer. This will be achieved through advanced computational molecular simulations and modeling techniques.

## Stages
The project is divided into four stages, each of which is elaborately described in the corresponding notebook:
1. **Protein and ligand library selection, protein and ligand preparation (complete)**
2. **Virtual screening with molecular docking (not yet complete)**
3. **Molecular dynamics simulation (not yet complete)**
4. **Binding affinity and energy analysis (not yet complete)**

The specific tools, libraries, and frameworks used throughout the project are documented in a separate file called requirements.txt.

## File order
To follow our process the notebooks should be read in the following order: 

**Stage 1** <br>
stage1.ipynb

**Stage 2** <br>
not yet complete

**Stage 3** <br>
not yet complete

**Stage 4** <br>
not yet complete

## Data
The links to our data can be found in stage1.ipynb.
