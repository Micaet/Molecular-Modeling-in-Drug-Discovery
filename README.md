# Molecular Modeling in Drug Discovery

## Project overview
The objective of this project is to identify a potent ligand inhibitor for the 5CNO protein (EGFR kinase), which is implicated in various types of cancer. This will be achieved through advanced computational molecular simulations and modeling techniques.

## Stages
The project is divided into four stages, each of which is elaborately described in the corresponding notebook:
1. **Protein and ligand library selection, protein and ligand preparation (Completed)**
2. **Virtual screening with molecular docking (Completed)**
3. **Molecular dynamics simulation (not yet completed)**
4. **Binding affinity and energy analysis (not yet completed)**

The specific tools, libraries, and frameworks used throughout the project are documented in a separate file called requirements.txt.

## File order
The notebook Molecular-Modeling-In-Drug-Discovery.ipynb is organized into sections that correspond to the stages outlined above.

To make it easier to locate a specific stage, the cell numbers where each section begins are listed below.

1. **Stage one:** Cells from 1 to y
1. **Stage two:** Cells from x to y
3. **Stage three:** Cells from x to y
4. **Stage four:** Cells from x to y

## Data
The links to our data can be found in stage1.ipynb.
